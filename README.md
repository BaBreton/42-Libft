# 42-Libft

Libft is a 42 school project that involves re-coding the basic functions of the C Language.
This Libft therefore contains the requested functions, as well as others for my personal use.

## Installation

You can compile the libft with :
```bash
  make
```
It will give you libft.a archive, which you can add to your project compilation with :

```bash
  -L path_to_libft -lft
````
